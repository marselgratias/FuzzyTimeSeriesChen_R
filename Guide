  There are certain data adjustments required to be implemented for the data to be accepted by the application. 
  One of these adjustments is adding a "penutupan" header to the Excel data sheet.

  2. Masukkan nilai D1 & Masukkan nilai D2
  This panel plays a role in determining the values of D1 and D2, which are positive coefficients that need to be defined by the researcher. 
  This is related to the formula for creating the universe of discourse in Fuzzy Time Series.
